# XCarbon

Save the earth! Join us to reduce our carbon footprint!

Winner of DeveloperWeek Hackathon 2020.

## What does it do?

A blockchain-based solution for Carbon detection. Carbon metrics would be captured from IoT devices, and stored onto an immutable ledger.

The government alone cannot reduce our carbon footprint. A massive problem needs to be solved by the masses. We cannot make progress on an issue that has not garnered public awareness. Through attaching IoT devices to public vehicles, we can increase the reach and mobility of the monitoring process.
